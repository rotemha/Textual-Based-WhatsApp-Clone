# WhatsApp! clone
A textual-based WhatsApp! clone. It contains most of the features of the original application imeplemented in Akka (using Java).

We will detail below the list of required features that must be implemented. Be sure to think in Actor Model mode, and not object-oriented mode. Make sure to incorporate the different behaviors needed for each Actor in the system.

The application relies on two main features:

  - 1-to-1 chat. In this feature a person using the application sends an addressed message to a specific destination.
  - 1-to-many chat. In this feature a person using the application sends a message addressed to the group itself. This message is broadcast
    to all members found in the specific group.
    
    
Specific instalation instructions can be found under "Akka Project" folder.
